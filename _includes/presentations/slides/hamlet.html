		<li>Say you were a theatre producer, Cameron Macintosh, and young playwright sends you an email that says, I’ve got some great words for a play…</li>
		<li>You can write a brief but until you actually have to talk to someone and explain it face to face maybe with some pictures, do you yourself really understand it as well as the other person. In development there’s an idea of rubber ducking.</li>

		<li>A shared document isn’t a shared understanding</li>
